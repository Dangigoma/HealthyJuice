<h2>Nutrituion and Health Benefit</h2>

<p>Wheatgrass is considered a superfood - loaded with vitamins and minerals; it can help purify the body, removing toxins, heavy metals and cancer-causing agents from the liver and bloodstream. The chlorophyll and other nutrients found in wheatgrass help reduce cell-damaging free radicals in the body. The damaging free radical molecules make it difficult for your body to repair itself and can cause organ degeneration and signs of aging.  Wheatgrass also works with your kidneys and liver to cleanse toxins from your body. Sometimes, your food can actually contaminate your body - and that's why you need to detox. The vitamins and nutrients it contains assist with the extraction of toxins and boosts your gut's ability to extract nutrients from the food you eat.</p>
